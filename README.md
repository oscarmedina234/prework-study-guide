# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description


I knew I was going to need to have all the info I learned in the prework course handy. I created this to use as a study guide durin boot camp to have easy acces to the info learned in the pre work course. It solved the problem of not remebering the stuff from the pre work course and having everything in one place. I learned alot about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

It can be used to study the information learned during the pre work course. Each section has notes about HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. If you open the DevTools console you can see the JavaScript running. It lists the topics we learned and even gives you a topic to study.
